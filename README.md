Welcome to my personal repository where I showcase the projects I developed during my Artificial Intelligence internship at TDS Avenue CodeForge!
This repository is a curated collection of the projects I worked on throughout my internship. It represents a journey of learning and experimentation with various AI technologies. Each project highlights different aspects of artificial intelligence, from initial research and data analysis to model development and final implementations.

**Project 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses**
Description: This project involves creating a rule-based chatbot designed to handle basic user interactions. The chatbot operates using predefined rules and patterns to generate responses. Itâ€™s an excellent example of simple natural language processing techniques applied to simulate human-like conversation in a controlled environment.
Features:
Rule-based response generation, 
Predefined conversation flows, 
Basic NLP techniques.

**Project 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI**
Description: This project focuses on implementing an AI agent for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI uses strategic algorithms to make optimal moves and win against human players. The project demonstrates basic game theory and AI decision-making processes.
Features:
AI with optimal move strategy, 
User interface for playing the game, 
Option to play against the AI.

**Project 3: Face Detection and Recognition**
Description: This project implements a face detection and recognition system using computer vision techniques. It can detect faces in images and recognize individual faces based on a trained model. The system is designed for applications requiring facial identification and verification.
Features:
Real-time face detection, 
Facial recognition using pre-trained models, 
Integration with image processing libraries.
